Here's a more structured and formatted version of your README file for a Next.js project:

# Next.js Weather App

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Install Dependencies

First, install the necessary packages by running one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and store your weather API key. The file should look like this:

```env
API_KEY=<Your API Key>
```

### Run the Development Server

Start the development server by running one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you make changes.

### Fonts

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load the Inter font, a custom Google Font.
